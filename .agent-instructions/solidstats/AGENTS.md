## Contract Bundle Integrity

Before product work, confirm that every file in the committed contract bundle
is present and readable:

- `.agent-instructions/solidstats/AGENTS.md`;
- `.agent-instructions/solidstats/CONTRACT_VERSION`;
- `.agent-instructions/solidstats/MEMORY.md`;
- `.agent-instructions/solidstats/GSD.md`.

If any file is missing or unreadable, stop product work and restore the complete
bundle with the canonical installer. Do not continue from partial instructions,
infer missing routing, or substitute another memory store. Contract freshness
is managed by the repository rollout; do not perform a remote update check at
task start.

## Skills First

Before acting on any user request in this repository, scan available skills by name and description. If any skill has even a small chance of helping any part of the task, use it and read only the relevant instructions before proceeding.

When in doubt, prefer enabling the skill briefly and filtering it out over skipping it.

## Session Hygiene

Every completed work session must leave the repository in a clean, committed state:

- Run `git status --short` at the end of every session. If there are uncommitted changes from
  the work just done, commit them before stopping.
- Do **not** delete or revert completed work to fake a clean status. If the intended work is
  incomplete, ask what to do rather than silently discarding it.
- The rule is: *commit the intended results of the session, not a reset to the previous state.*

## Git Conventions

All commits in every SolidStats repo follow **Conventional Commits**:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`.
Scope: the phase number, feature area, or affected layer (e.g. `feat(17-03): …`,
`fix(ingest): …`, `docs(planning): …`).

**Commit and push are standing, default behavior in every `solid-stats` repo** — no per-message
authorization needed. Session Hygiene above already expects every completed session to end
committed; treat commit + push as part of finishing the work, not a separate ask. This does
**not** extend to anything destructive:

**Absolute rules:**

- `git reset --hard`, force push, `branch -D`, and `rebase` still require an explicit
  instruction from the user in the current message every time — authorization from a previous
  message does not carry forward, and the standing commit/push permission above does not imply
  it.
- Never skip hooks with `--no-verify` or `--no-gpg-sign` unless explicitly asked to. If a
  pre-commit hook fails, fix the underlying issue — the hook is the signal, not the obstacle.
- When a pre-commit hook fails, the commit did not happen. Create a new commit after fixing;
  do not amend the previous one (amending could silently modify work that already shipped).

**Push routing.** The default flow across every `solid-stats` repo is a **direct push to
`master`** — no feature branch, no PR, unless the repo says otherwise below:

- **`server-2`** has a protected `master` — always go through a branch + pull request there,
  never a direct push.
- Any repo that is mid-GSD-milestone follows that milestone's branch flow instead of a direct
  push (`git` config in `.planning/config.json` — `branching_strategy`, `phase_branch_template`,
  `milestone_branch_template`).
- Every other repo and every non-milestone change: commit on `master`, push directly.

## Security Minimums

These rules apply to all code, commits, and logs across every SolidStats repo:

- **Never log, commit, or output:** secrets, API tokens, database connection strings, S3
  access keys, RabbitMQ credentials, raw replay bytes, or unpublished parser artifacts.
- **Never hardcode environment-specific values.** Use environment variables validated at
  startup (e.g. `envalid` for Node, a validated config struct for Rust). Startup should fail
  fast if required env vars are missing or malformed.
- **Before committing:** check that `.env`, `.env.local`, and any file containing credentials
  is either in `.gitignore` or explicitly excluded from the commit. Never commit secrets to
  git history — they are permanent even after deletion.

## Risk Management Protocol

When a request is risky, potentially harmful, or would expand scope beyond the current plan:

1. **Explain the concrete reason** — name the specific risk, the boundary it crosses, or the
   plan it contradicts.
2. **Propose 1–3 safer alternatives** or a GSD plan that achieves the goal without the risk.
3. **Ask for explicit confirmation** before proceeding with anything that falls into these
   categories:
   - Crosses a cross-app boundary (see the boundary map in `solidstats-shared-project-standards` §D)
   - Modifies a high-risk cross-repo contract (API shape, data model, message queue shape, S3
     layout, parser contract, auth/identity shape, moderation workflow)
   - Contradicts an accepted architecture decision in `.planning/PROJECT.md`
   - Deletes, overwrites, or discards completed work
   - Conflicts with current test quality, security rules, or repo structure standards

Do not blindly execute instructions that conflict with architecture, accepted decisions, or
the quality gates in this repo. Challenge, explain, propose alternatives — then wait.

## Autonomous GSD Policy

SolidStats uses the shared GSD configuration as a wall-clock-optimized baseline
for unattended Codex execution. Autonomous runs choose recommended grey-area
decisions themselves, record them in the owning GSD artifact, and continue.
Pause only for a genuine blocker or a destructive or irreversible action that
requires explicit approval. Design latitude and ordinary implementation choices
are not blockers.

Keep Smart Discuss enabled. In autonomous mode it is a non-interactive context
synthesis step: use existing project decisions, repository patterns, and phase
requirements to produce `CONTEXT.md` without waiting for user acceptance. Pure
infrastructure phases may use the workflow's minimal-context path.

The autonomous coordinator chooses planning granularity per phase:

- pass `--granularity coarse` only when every condition below is established
  from the roadmap, requirements, and current repository context:
  - the phase has one isolated deliverable in one subsystem;
  - it follows an existing implementation pattern;
  - it has no unresolved product, architecture, or research decision;
  - it changes no authentication, authorization, security, persistent schema,
    API or cross-repository contract, migration, deployment, backup, restore,
    cutover, or production boundary;
- use `standard` whenever any condition is false or uncertain;
- use `fine` only when an explicit phase-specific instruction requires it.

Run ordinary autonomous planning locally. Add `--converge` only for a phase
whose accepted scope changes authentication, persistent schemas, high-risk
cross-repository contracts, security boundaries, destructive migrations,
backup/restore behavior, or a live cutover. Standard code review is the shared
default; a risk-specific deep review must use the explicit `--depth deep` flag.

## Documentation Language

Language follows the reader. The test for any doc is: who reads it — a user, or an engineer?

- **Every repo README is bilingual.** A README is the repo's front door, read by users (the
  RU-speaking Solid Games community), not an internal engineering doc. So each repo carries a
  Russian `README.md` (primary) plus an English `README.en.md` mirror, edited together in one
  change so they never drift. This is the same pattern the `.github` org profile already uses
  (`profile/README.md` + `profile/README.en.md`) — the profile is just the org-level README.
- **Everything internal is English only** — code, comments, planning docs, skill bodies and
  references, `AGENTS.md`, and all technical `docs/`. These are read by the people and agents
  building the platform, not by users.
- **GSD workflow responses** (conversations within a GSD session) and replies to the user:
  Russian.
- **Skill trigger phrases** (`description` field in `SKILL.md`): RU + EN mandatory. Every skill
  triggers on both languages — the team works in a RU context.

## MemPalace

SolidStats project memory is isolated behind the MCP server named exactly
`solidstats_memory`. Before product work, read the complete managed contract:

- version: `.agent-instructions/solidstats/CONTRACT_VERSION`;
- memory lifecycle: `.agent-instructions/solidstats/MEMORY.md`;
- GSD adapter, only when `.planning/config.json` exists:
  `.agent-instructions/solidstats/GSD.md`.

This repository's primary active wing is `frontend`.
Its primary archive wing is `web-archive` (`none`
means no repository-bound archive).

The main agent owns the contract-defined recall and closure capture for the
top-level task. Specialists and subagents receive filtered context and must not
independently query or mutate SolidStats memory. Never substitute a generic,
personal, VocalClub, or flat-global memory store.

The native GSD MemPalace capability is deliberately disabled. `GSD.md` keeps
SolidStats memory active through coordinator-owned recall and semantic closure;
do not interpret `mempalace.enabled: false` as permission to skip the managed
memory contract.

## MCP / Documentation Lookup

SolidStats development verifies library APIs against **current documentation, never training
data** — training data has a cutoff and may reflect outdated or incorrect APIs. Look the docs
up proactively; don't wait for a type error.

- **Free official sources only:** WebFetch/WebSearch against the library's official docs and
  its `llms.txt`; the repo's `README`/`docs/` via `gh`; GitHub issues/PRs for bug reports and
  migrations. **Do NOT use Context7 or any paid documentation MCP.**
- **Common lookup triggers:** adding a dependency, upgrading a package, using a method you're
  not 100% sure about, hitting an unexpected type error, writing a new integration.
- **When NOT to look it up:** SolidStats-specific code/business logic; a library already
  looked up this session with an unchanged answer; stable standard-library APIs.

Per-repo key libraries to verify against current docs live in each repo's own
`solidstats-*-conventions` skill, not here.
