# Changelog — solidstats-shared-review-standards

## 2026-06-20 — make direct-invoke only via `disable-model-invocation`
- Added `disable-model-invocation: true` to the frontmatter. Per the Claude Code skills docs this removes the skill's description from per-session context entirely (not just shortens it), so it now costs zero tokens per session in every consuming repo while the FULL description is kept as documentation. The skill is still invoked by name (and read by its hard-requirers via file path); Claude no longer auto-triggers it.


## 2026-06-16 — Discovery step + review lenses
- §I **Discovery — locate the plan, map the change** (new). Conditional GSD-sync pass adapted from
  `estesis-frontend-react-vc-code-review` (`references/gsd-sync.md`): I.1 self-discovery of the
  planning context (branch slug → handoff/state → file overlap, ambiguity rule = exactly one or ASK);
  I.2 **map the change onto the codebase** — the structural `.planning/codebase/` map (STRUCTURE/
  ARCHITECTURE/INTEGRATIONS/CONVENTIONS/CONCERNS/STACK/TESTING) as a first-class source, plus the
  knowledge-graph blast-radius map (review half of GSD-IMPROVEMENTS C6 — `/gsd-graphify query` /
  `GRAPH_COMMUNITIES.md`, fallback to intel/grep, else a Validation Gap); I.3 code-vs-PLAN contract
  check (`files_modified`/`must_haves`/`<success_criteria>`/`requirements` + SUMMARY / REVIEW+REVIEW-FIX
  / VERIFICATION claim reconciliation, severity-by-drift table) with neutral direction-of-truth,
  semantic-truths → Validation Gaps, read-only on `.planning/`, `[gsd-plan]`/`[gsd-claim]` tags.
- §J **Review lenses** (new). Implements Improvement 2 from
  `plans/product/BMAD-EVALUATION-AND-GSD-IMPROVEMENTS.md` (decision D3): the three named adversarial
  lenses (Contract Adversary / Edge / Failure Hunter / Acceptance Auditor), the one-format invariant
  ("many lenses, one report"), the adversarial-mandate-as-Non-Findings-Checked rule, the explicit
  rejection of the "zero findings → halt / forced finding" rule (it fights §G), and the depth-tied
  fan-out (single pass for quick; parallel-subagent lenses for deep, run at the invocation layer via the
  `solidstats-process-review-lenses` skill — never in the vendored GSD review commands). Includes a
  **durability-across-GSD-updates** note: lenses degrade to sequential passes and never depend on the
  fan-out; the fan-out is never wired by editing vendored gsd-core (re-vendored on update) — it is
  driven from the invocation layer (the session/Workflow that can spawn agents) or an upstream change
  (GSD's `config.json` `hooks` are feature toggles, not a script extension point). Adds the **soft
  trigger**: a single-pass deep review ends its report with a one-line recommendation (quoting the
  `Workflow(...)` invocation) so the fan-out reaches a spawn-capable session/human without coupling to
  any vendored GSD file; lens subagents inside the fan-out suppress it to avoid a loop. Reference
  implementation + trigger wrapper: the `solidstats-process-review-lenses` skill (bundled
  `workflows/review-lenses.workflow.js`).
- Additive only — §A–§H unchanged, so the reviewers' `§C`/`§D`/`§E`/`§F` cross-references still hold.
- Provenance: ADR `decisions/0007-bmad-borrowed-improvements.md`.

## 2026-06-06 — Calibration (user-confirmed)
- §C: "blocking I/O on an async path" moved from 🔴 to 🟠 (🔴 only when it stalls a hot/shared path);
  "missing important test" severity now stated as owned by §F (single source).

## 2026-06-06 — Analysis fix (see .planning/SKILLS-ANALYSIS.md)
- §E verdict: a review with only 🔵 findings now → **APPROVE** (note the optional nits), instead of
  being forced to REQUEST CHANGES — reconciles §E with §C marking 🔵 as "optional."

## 2026-06-05 — Initial
- Adapted from `estesis-process-review-standards` (stack-agnostic review foundation).
- Retargeted name, description, and body to the SolidStats reviewers:
  `solidstats-server-ts-code-review`, `solidstats-parser-rust-code-review`,
  `solidstats-frontend-react-code-review`.
- Kept severity buckets (🔴🟠🟡🔵), continuous-numbering output format, verdict rules,
  scope discipline, the test-file rule, and the noise filter verbatim.
- Generalized the reviewer hard-gate example from the estesis Swagger spec gate to a
  typecheck/lint gate; added Clippy to the convention-reference examples; changed sample
  `file:line` paths to `.ts`.
- Dropped the spec-scale severity mapping (no spec-review skill in the v1 set).
- Review report language set to **English** (diverges from estesis, which mandates Russian) —
  matches the SolidStats "documentation is English only" standard.
